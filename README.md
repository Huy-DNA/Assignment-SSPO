## Developer's guide

* Package manager: `yarn`
  Run scripts and install using `yarn` instead of `npm`.

* `yarn dev` should suffice in most cases. It automatically rebuild backend & frontend on change and restarting the server. However, the page must be refreshed to see the change.

* Before commit, `husky` will automatically run lint check and test files.

* During development, the site is available on localhost:3000.
